                            affects a number of plants.Rake up and destroy
                            infected leaves to reduce the spread of spores.
                            Also, give plants good drainage and ample air
                            circulation. Avoid overhead watering at night;
                            mid-morning is preferred to allow foliage to dry
                            before evening. Commercial fungicides are available

                            Verticillium wilt is a fungal disease that affects
                            hundreds of species of trees, shrubs, edibles and
                            ornamentals. Fungicides are not effective, but good
                            sanitation practices may help. Remove and destroy
                            infected annuals, perennials and edibles. Prune
                            diseased branches off trees and shrubs. (When you do
                            this, youâ€™ll notice a telltale green streak or stain
                            in the wood.).It can also lead to stunned growth.{" "}

                            Snow mold is a fungus that flourishes in the cold,

                            visible: light tan areas of matted grass caused by
                            threads of mold.Rake the matted grass to break up
                            the mold and allow for new growth. In fall, make the
                            last cutting of the year shorter to discourage tall
                            grass blades from falling over and contributing to
                            matting.
